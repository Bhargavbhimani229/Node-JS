what is node js ?

Node.js is like a tool that lets you run JavaScript on your computer, not just in a browser. It’s super useful for building fast, scalable apps, 
especially for the web. Think of it as the engine that powers your favorite car but for running JavaScript everywhere.


why are you used in node js?

We use Node.js because it’s great for building fast, real-time, and scalable applications. Here are the main reasons:

1. Fast Execution: Node.js uses the V8 engine (Google’s JavaScript engine), which makes it super quick for running code.
2. Handles Many Users at Once: It’s non-blocking, meaning it can handle multiple tasks simultaneously without waiting for one to finish before starting another.
3. Single Language for Backend: With Node.js, you can use JavaScript for both frontend and backend, making development simpler and more unified.
4. Real-Time Applications: Perfect for chat apps, live streaming, or games because it handles updates instantly.
5. Huge Community: Lots of libraries (via npm) make adding features like authentication or data storage much easier.
